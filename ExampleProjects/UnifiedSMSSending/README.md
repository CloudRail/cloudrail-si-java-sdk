# Unified SMS Sending example
This is a simple example that shows how you can use the [CloudRail Unified SMS Sending API](https://cloudrail.com/integrations/interfaces/SMS;platformId=Java) to integrate different SMS Sending services in one application.

## Prerequisites

You need to have developer credentials for the services you want to use. Instructions on how they can be acquired can be found on our [Unified SMS Sending API site](https://cloudrail.com/integrations/interfaces/SMS;platformId=Java). You also need a CloudRail API key that you can [get fro free here](https://cloudrail.com/signup).

Open your *Main.java* file and enter your CloudRail Key, the developer credentials for the SMS Sending services, and the sending and receiving phone numbers (or names).

## Running the Program

After starting, the program will send a SMS to the specified recipient for each of the services.
